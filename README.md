### Project Overview

This project is all about a bank that  have an issue of customers just leaving their bank and they want be able to identify those customers before they leave with following features, using Artificial Neutral Network.

### Data source
Data: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Churn_Modelling.csv" file containing detailed information about each customer

### Tools
- Artificial Neural Network  - for modeling [download here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prisca-ukanwa-800a1117a_predicting-bank-customers-activity-7239970474091307008-orRG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android)
- Python-Analysis and data cleaning
- Matplotlib - for visulaization
- Sklearn - for machine learning

### Data Cleaning
1. Data laodng
2. Handling duplicates
3. Handling missing values
4. shape and data types

### Exporatory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the data to answer key questons
- The amouunt of data that left the bank already
- The age range of customers that are likely to leave
- At what point ,do customers leav?

  ### Data analysis
  To get the data info in python
  df.info(),  for data info
  df.shapes , for the size of the data

  ### Solution
  An Artificial Neural Network model was built in order for the bank to identify the customers before the decides to leave the bank
  using customers details provided in the dataset.

  ### Recommendation
The bank should print questionaires to get customer responses
They bank should also verify customer view of the bank
They bank should have suggestion box in the bank so that customer can air their opinion, from there, measures can be taken
They bank should ensure that the staffs are of best behavior and offer exceptional services

### Limitations
i remove columns like customer id,row_number and customer surname because the wont add value to the analysis and can cause noise when 
building a model
